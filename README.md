Stunting, wasting, obesity and micronutrient deficiencies are very significant health problems in Indonesia. Based on data from the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) in 2018, there were 20 million people in Indonesia who were undernourished and chronically malnourished or stunted. High stunting rates indicate stunted physical and cognitive growth in children, while high wasting rates indicate acute malnutrition. In addition, obesity and micronutrient deficiencies also cause various long-term health problems, like chronic disease risk and reduced quality of life. One of the contributing factors is the lack of understanding about a healthy diet and proper nutrition. Many people are less concerned about the nutritional value of the food they consume daily. Therefore, an innovation is needed that can provide an understanding of a healthy diet.
In this case, our team developed the "Calorties" application system that can calculate nutrients and calories in the food consumed. "Calorties (Calories Tracking to Manage Your Daily Calorie)" aims to find out the nutrients and calculate the calories contained in food. The system is designed for users of various age categories in Indonesia, ranging from children to adults. By using this system, users will be able to easily find out the nutritional value and calories of the food they consume daily. By utilizing image recognition that uses the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm as a food image detection feature, it allows users to find out the nutrients and calories in the food consumed through the camera/photo feature provided. Through the use of this application system, people can be more aware of the importance of a healthy diet and understand the nutritional value of the foods they choose and ensure their daily calorie and nutrient needs are met, thereby reducing the risk of stunting, wasting, obesity, and micronutrient deficiencies.
